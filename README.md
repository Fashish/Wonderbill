I have used the TestCafe framework to complete the task given from Wonderbill and create the script requested to retrieve account details from the account provided.

To install simply run 
```
npm install
```

And to run the test/script:
```
npm test
```

Currently the framework is using the Chrome browser, which would have to be installed locally/inside docker. If the browser needs to be changed, then it can be done in the `.testcaferc.json` configuration file.
